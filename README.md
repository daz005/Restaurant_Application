# Little Lemon iOS Application

## iOS Project Description

This application showcased the implementation of a food ordering app for the Little Lemon restaurant. This was created with React Native and SwiftUI on XCode. This also features utilzing API calls. The app offers a customizable user experience, allowing users to filter items by specified categories and search for items by name. 

Here's an overview of the completed app:
Item Display: The app effectively showcases a comprehensive list of items available for order.
User Customization: Users can tailor their experience by enabling filters or using the search feature.
Visual Representation: The accompanying images illustrate the final appearance of the app.

However, one initial hurdle was the absence of a menu items list, which has been addressed through the following steps:
Data Retrieval: Implemented a network call to fetch menu item data from a provided URL.
Database Integration: The retrieved data has been seamlessly stored in a database.

To ensure optimal presentation within the app, the following steps were taken:
Code Transformation: Wrote code to convert raw data into a suitable format for SwiftUI.
SQL Transactions: Implemented SQL transactions to enable efficient sorting and filtering of data.
The app is now fully equipped to deliver a robust and user-centric food ordering experience.
